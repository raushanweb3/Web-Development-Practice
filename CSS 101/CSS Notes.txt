CSS = Cascading Style sheet

CSS rules: almost everything in CSS follows this basic pattern:
selector {
    property: value;
}

* - selects everything

element1, element2 {
    this can also be another way of selecting multiple items    
}

ID selector
- starts with #
- a unique ID should be used only once not more

class selector
- starts with .
- class can be applied to multiple elements

Descendant selector
- written as space between two elements
- suppose we want to format all <a> tags that are inside <li> tags, we can do something like the following:
li a { <!-- notice the space and NOT comma -->
    your formatting goes here
}

Do look at attribute selectors

Pseudo Classes
- selection when a particular element is in a particular state like hover etc

Order in which you declare formatting in CSS matters. Later one overrides the previous one

However, Specificity is a different concept.

Specificity 
- It is how the browser decides which rules to apply when multiple rules could apply to the same element
- It is a measure of how specific a given selector is. The more specific selector "WINS"
- Order: Important declaration > Inline Style > ID selector > Class selector  
- DON'T use important declaration and Inline style
> Element selector
